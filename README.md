    1. Item 1 First do 'npm install' as I am not adding nodemodules.

    1. Item 2 So we will be using a vitual server ... tension not
        1. Item 2a Run 'npm install json-server -g' (this may not be required as this is gonna be added in package .    json during installation)
        1. Item 2b Run 'json-server --watch db.json --port 4000' on other terminal .. now this is important as this is going to create a new virtual server on port 4000 . http://localhost:4000/ <--click on this you must be seeing this. 

                Resources-
                        http://localhost:4000/table
                        http://localhost:4000/products
